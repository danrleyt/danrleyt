### Hi, I'm Dan 👋

I'm a Software Engineer with an international career, currently working at Just Eat Takeaway.com as a Backend Developer. 

I started my career as a Frontend Engineer and with time I have been moving to the Backend where I am currently focusing on, although I love both words ❤️.

I have a passion for learning, having fun and enjoying some beers with friends.
