### Hi, I'm Dan 👋

I'm a Software Engineer with an international career, currently I am adventuring myself as an Engineering Manager. 

I started my career as a Frontend Engineer and with time I have been momving to the Backend where I am currently focusing on, although I love both words ❤️.

I have a passion for learning, having fun and enjoying some beer with friends.
